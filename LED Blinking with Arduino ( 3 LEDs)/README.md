**Equipment List:**

1. Arduino Uno board
2. USB cable (for programming and power)
3. 3 Ã— Red LEDs
4. 3 Ã— 220Î© resistors
5. Jumper wires (Male-to-Male)

**Experiment Description (Short):**
In this experiment, multiple LEDs are connected to different digital pins of the Arduino Uno. The Arduino is programmed to turn the LEDs on and off in a sequence, creating a blinking pattern. This helps in understanding digital output control, timing, and basic programming of Arduino for controlling multiple components simultaneously.
