**Equipment List:**

1. Arduino Uno board
2. USB cable (for programming and power)
3. 5 √ó Red LEDs
4. 5 √ó 220Œ© resistors
5. Jumper wires (Male-to-Male)

**Experiment Description (Short):**
In this experiment, five LEDs are connected to different Arduino digital pins. The Arduino is programmed to turn the LEDs on and off one after another, creating a ‚Äúchaser‚Äù or ‚Äúrunning light‚Äù effect. This experiment demonstrates control over multiple digital outputs and the use of loops and delays in Arduino programming.
